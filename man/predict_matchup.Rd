\title{Predict Matchup Scores for Two Teams}
\usage{
predict_matchup(team1_url, team2_url, model_results)
}
\arguments{
\item{team1_url}{A string containing the URL of the first team's season statistics page.}

\item{team2_url}{A string containing the URL of the second team's season statistics page.}

\item{model_results}{A list containing pre-trained models for predicting scores. The list must include:
\itemize{
\item \code{home_model} - A model object for predicting the home team's score.
\item \code{away_model} - A model object for predicting the away team's score.
}}
}
\value{
A list with the predicted results for the matchup:
\itemize{
\item \code{away_team} - Name of the away team.
\item \code{home_team} - Name of the home team.
\item \code{predicted_away_points} - Predicted score for the away team.
\item \code{predicted_home_points} - Predicted score for the home team.
}
}
\description{
This function predicts the scores of a basketball matchup between two teams using pre-trained models and the teams' four-factor metrics.
It calculates each team's statistics, creates a dataset for prediction, and uses the provided models to estimate the final scores.
