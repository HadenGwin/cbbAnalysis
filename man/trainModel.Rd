\title{Train Random Forest Models for Predicting Basketball Matchup Outcomes}
\usage{
trainModel(start_date, end_date, num_games_per_day = 10, ntree = 500)
}
\arguments{
\item{start_date}{A string representing the start date for scraping matchups in \code{YYYY-MM-DD} format.}

\item{end_date}{A string representing the end date for scraping matchups in \code{YYYY-MM-DD} format.}

\item{num_games_per_day}{An integer specifying the number of games to scrape per day (default: 10).}

\item{ntree}{An integer specifying the number of trees to use in the Random Forest models (default: 500).}
}
\value{
A list containing the following components:
\itemize{
\item \code{home_model} - The trained Random Forest model for predicting home team scores.
\item \code{away_model} - The trained Random Forest model for predicting away team scores.
\item \code{home_rmse} - The root mean square error (RMSE) of the home model on the test set.
\item \code{away_rmse} - The root mean square error (RMSE) of the away model on the test set.
\item \code{predictions} - A data frame containing predictions and actual scores for the test set, including:
\itemize{
\item \code{game_id} - The unique game identifier.
\item \code{home_team} - The name of the home team.
\item \code{away_team} - The name of the away team.
\item \code{actual_home} - The actual score of the home team.
\item \code{predicted_home} - The predicted score of the home team.
\item \code{actual_away} - The actual score of the away team.
\item \code{predicted_away} - The predicted score of the away team.

\description{
This function trains Random Forest models to predict basketball matchup scores using historical data
scraped from Sports Reference. The models are trained separately for home and away teams, using
calculated four-factor metrics and additional derived features.
}
\details{
This function performs the following steps:
\enumerate{
\item Scrapes matchup data for the specified date range.
\item Extracts four-factor metrics for each matchup.
\item Prepares the data for training, including feature engineering.
\item Splits the data into training and testing sets.
\item Trains separate Random Forest models for home and away team score predictions.
\item Evaluates the models using RMSE on the test set.
}
